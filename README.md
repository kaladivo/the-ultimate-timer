# The ultimate timer
This repository contains code for the timer tool I build. I decided to create it because I was unable to find any other timer app that does not look like app from year 2000. 

I plan to extend this app and make it better with more features. See todo.md file.

The version of this app in master branch can be viewed [here](https://timer.davenov.com).

## How to develop this app 
1. Copy .env.example to .env.local (you can also use .env.developement.local)
2. Run `yarn` command
3. Run `yarn start` command
4. Enjoy!

This app was created with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). I would like to confess my deepest love to that tool, it is just amazing. 

I ejected it and modified babel configuration so I can use decorators...
